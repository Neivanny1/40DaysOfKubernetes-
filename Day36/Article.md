# Day 36/40 - Kubernetes Logging and Monitoring Simplified

<img src='./assets/36.jpg'>

Logging and monitoring are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of Kubernetes clusters. They provide visibility into cluster operations, enabling administrators to detect, debug, and resolve issues effectively.

## What Is Kubernetes Logging and Monitoring?

* Logging: Captures system messages, application logs, and events occurring within the cluster.
* Monitoring: Tracks cluster metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.) to analyze performance trends and detect anomalies.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Kubernetes Logging and Monitoring

#### Step 1: Install Metrics Server

The Metrics Server collects resource usage data from Kubernetes nodes and pods. Follow the official documentation to install it.

1. Clone the Metrics Server repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server.git
cd metrics-server
```

2. Deploy Metrics Server:
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```

3. Verify installation:

```
kubectl get apiservices
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
```

#### Step 2: Enable Logging

Logging in Kubernetes is achieved through log aggregation solutions like Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK).

1. View logs of a specific pod:
```
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

2. Stream logs in real time:
```
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
```

3. Check logs for multiple pods in a Deployment:

```
kubectl logs -l app=<deployment-name>
```

4. For advanced logging, integrate Fluentd and Elasticsearch for centralized log management.

#### Step 3: Explore Monitoring Tools

Kubernetes supports various monitoring tools for in-depth insights:

##### 1. Prometheus and Grafana:
* Prometheus collects metrics from cluster components and applications.
* Grafana visualizes these metrics in dashboards.

Deploy Prometheus:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml
```

##### 2. Kubernetes Dashboard:
Provides a web-based UI to monitor the cluster.

Deploy the Dashboard:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

## Insights from This Exercise

* Centralized Monitoring: Tools like Metrics Server and Prometheus make resource monitoring seamless.
* Proactive Maintenance: Logs provide critical insights for debugging and preventing downtime.
* Scalable Solutions: Kubernetes integrates well with external tools to handle large-scale monitoring and logging.
