Day 31/40 - Understanding CoreDNS in Kubernetes 🧭🔍

Today’s focus was on CoreDNS, the default DNS server and service discovery mechanism in Kubernetes. CoreDNS is a critical component for managing cluster-wide DNS, enabling seamless communication between services.

🤔 What is CoreDNS?

CoreDNS is a flexible and extensible DNS server designed specifically for Kubernetes. It acts as the default cluster DNS, resolving service names to their corresponding IPs within a Kubernetes environment. Beyond simple DNS queries, CoreDNS supports advanced features like service discovery, load balancing, and custom DNS plugins.

📋 Key Steps for Exploring CoreDNS

    Check the CoreDNS Deployment:
    To verify that CoreDNS is running in your cluster:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system

Look for coredns pods in the output.

Inspect the CoreDNS ConfigMap:
CoreDNS configuration is managed via a ConfigMap. Retrieve it using:

kubectl -n kube-system get configmap coredns -o yaml

Example of CoreDNS configuration:

.:53 {
    errors
    health
    ready
    kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
        pods insecure
        fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
    }
    prometheus :9153
    forward . /etc/resolv.conf
    cache 30
    loop
    reload
    loadbalance
}

Modify CoreDNS ConfigMap:
To enable additional features or debugging, you can edit the ConfigMap:

kubectl -n kube-system edit configmap coredns

Test CoreDNS Resolution:
To test DNS resolution from within a pod:

    kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nslookup <service-name>

    Replace <service-name> with the name of the service you want to resolve.

🔍 Key Observations

    Service Discovery: CoreDNS seamlessly maps service names to cluster IPs, enabling communication between pods.
    Custom Plugins: CoreDNS supports plugins for extended functionality like metrics, debugging, and more.
    Configurable Behavior: By modifying the ConfigMap, you can customize CoreDNS behavior to fit specific requirements.

📝 Key Takeaways

    CoreDNS is essential for Kubernetes networking: It handles DNS-based service discovery and routing.
    Flexibility and Extensibility: With its plugin architecture, CoreDNS can adapt to varied use cases.
    Centralized Management: Using ConfigMaps, administrators can manage CoreDNS configurations cluster-wide.
